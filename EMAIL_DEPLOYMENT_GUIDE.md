```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Gmail Issues

**Error: "Invalid credentials"**
- Check that 2FA is enabled
- Verify app password is correct
- Ensure GMAIL_USER is your full Gmail address

**Error: "Connection timeout"**
- Check firewall settings
- Verify GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD is correct
- Try regenerating app password

### Brevo Issues

**Error: "SMTP account not activated"**
- Contact Brevo support at contact@brevo.com
- Request SMTP account activation
- Wait for confirmation email

**Error: "Invalid API key"**
- Check API key in Brevo dashboard
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters
- Verify key has email sending permissions

### General Issues

**Emails not sending:**
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify service is redeployed after changes
- Check logs for specific error messages
- Test with the provided test script

## üì± Production Considerations

### For Production Use:

1. **Set up proper domain email** (not Gmail)
2. **Configure SPF/DKIM records**
3. **Monitor email delivery rates**
4. **Set up email templates**
5. **Implement email queuing for high volume**

### Current Fallback Behavior:

- If email services fail, verification codes are logged to console
- Users can still complete registration
- This ensures the app doesn't break during email service issues

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Choose your email service** (Gmail or Brevo)
2. **Set up the service** following the steps above
3. **Update environment variables** in your deployment platform
4. **Test the configuration** using the test script
5. **Redeploy your application**
6. **Verify email sending works** in production

## üìû Support

If you continue to have issues:

1. Check the application logs for specific error messages
2. Run the test script to diagnose configuration issues
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Contact the respective email service support if needed

The application will continue to work even with email issues - users will see verification codes in the console logs for development purposes.
